# Egg intake by diabetic status — PREDIMED substudy (Díez-Espino 2017)

## Ingestion Layer
*Mechanical pass. No interpretation below this point — only the source quote and its forced E-Prime rewrite.*

### Original Quote
"There was no evidence of interaction by diabetic status"

### E-Prime Rewrite
The diabetic-subgroup HR (1.33, CI 0.72–2.46) and non-diabetic HR (0.96, CI 0.33–2.76) overlapped enough that the formal interaction test failed to reach significance.

## Assessment Layer
*Checkable pass, run against the ingestion output above. See [[two-layer-architecture-v1]] for the assessment criteria each subsection below must satisfy.*

### Analysis
"No evidence of interaction" reads as definitive — as if diabetes status doesn't matter here. The rewrite forces the actual numbers into view: a 38% relative difference in point estimate (1.33 vs 0.96) sits underneath a statistically null interaction test, because both confidence intervals are wide enough to overlap heavily.

This rewrite carries the highest confidence of the three eggs claims (score 5) because the rewrite adds no interpretation beyond restating the source's own numbers — but it also matters most, because it exposes that "no evidence of interaction" actually means "underpowered to detect an interaction," not "detected absence of interaction." Those differ as epistemic states, and the standard-summary collapse of one into the other gives the single clearest case of evaluative-language smuggling found across all nine claims in this vault.

### Ambiguity Flags
- None in the rewrite itself — the ambiguity lives entirely in the source's plain-language conclusion, which the rewrite exposes rather than resolves.

### Adversarial Interpretation
A reader could cite "no evidence of interaction" to claim the [[eggs-001]] diabetes-specific finding doesn't replicate. The rewrite shows this citation would be misleading: the result is silent on replication, not contradictory to it.

## Related Claims
- [[eggs-001]] — whether this study's diabetic HR (1.33) corroborates or undermines Li 2013's diabetes-specific RR (1.83)
- [[eggs-002]] — both null-result studies share the underpowered-vs-absent ambiguity, though [[eggs-002]] hides it behind adjustment-model conditionality instead of subgroup power
