# LHC safety — cosmic ray energy-equivalence argument (CERN FAQ)

## Ingestion Layer
*Mechanical pass. No interpretation below this point — only the source quote and its forced E-Prime rewrite.*

### Original Quote
"The LHC can only reproduce phenomena that already happen naturally all around us... If such phenomena were dangerous or destructive, it would contradict what we see: stars, galaxies and the Earth still exist."

### E-Prime Rewrite
Cosmic ray collisions strike Earth's atmosphere at energies matching or exceeding LHC collision energies, at a rate exceeding 10 million million per second across the universe; the Earth's continued existence over ~4.5 billion years constrains how dangerous *those specific collisions* can be.

## Assessment Layer
*Checkable pass, run against the ingestion output above. See [[two-layer-architecture-v1]] for the assessment criteria each subsection below must satisfy.*

### Analysis
"Phenomena that already happen naturally" sounds unrestricted, as if it covers everything the LHC does. Forced to specify, the claim narrows to a specific scope: collision energy and rate, observed via cosmic rays striking *stationary* targets (the atmosphere, the Moon, other stars).

This exposes a scope gap CERN's FAQ doesn't address: LHC collisions involve two fast-moving particles striking each other head-on in the center-of-momentum frame — a different collision geometry than a fast particle striking a stationary target. The energy-equivalence argument doesn't automatically establish geometry-equivalence, and nothing in this FAQ text closes that gap. This gives the first confirmed instance of the predicted "scope-dependency" category in [[insight-contribution-v1]] — a claim true within an unstated parameter range, presented as if unconditionally true.

### Ambiguity Flags
- Source conflates "phenomena happen naturally" (true for cosmic-ray-type collisions) with "LHC reproduces the same phenomena" (requires the unaddressed geometry-equivalence assumption).

### Adversarial Interpretation
A reader skeptical of LHC safety could press exactly this geometry gap. A reader confident in LHC safety could note that CERN's fuller safety case (LSAG 2008, not ingested in this vault yet) likely addresses collision geometry directly — this FAQ excerpt simply doesn't surface it.

## Related Claims
- [[blackhole-002]] — addresses a different failure mode (evaporation behavior rather than formation-energy regime); the two claims are not fully independent safety arguments despite reading that way in the source
