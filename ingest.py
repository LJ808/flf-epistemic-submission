E-Prime Ingestion + Assessment Tool — FLF Submission
=====================================================

Two-layer architecture (revised 2026-06-30, after FLF early-feedback review
named the original single-pass version "rhetoric linting" -- ingestion and
assessment fused with no separable structure or checking step):

    Ingestion Layer  -- ingest_claim()  -- mechanical E-Prime rewrite only
    Assessment Layer -- assess_claim()  -- takes Ingestion Layer output as
                                            its required input, runs the
                                            checkable analysis/ambiguity/
                                            adversarial pass against it

See SYNTHESIS/two-layer-architecture-v1.md for the assessment-layer criteria
each Assessment output must satisfy.

NOTE ON A SECOND, DIFFERENT "TWO-LAYER" PROPOSAL: literature-engagement-
addendum-v1.md separately proposes a generation/disclosure split -- a shallow
filler-word ban for generation-stage synthesis (per Jehu-Appiah 2026), E-Prime
reserved for disclosure-stage rewriting. That split cuts along a different
axis than the Ingestion/Assessment split above, and the addendum named it as
an untested, falsifiable proposal, not yet built. This file's
COMPARE-FILLER-BAN HARNESS section below builds the apparatus for that test --
it does not run it. No ANTHROPIC_API_KEY exists in the environment that wrote
this; running the comparison and reporting a real result counts as next-steps work,
named explicitly in the submission as something this proposal would execute
if it advances.

QUICK START:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
    python3 ingest.py "There is a positive association between egg consumption and CVD risk"

    # Run the Ingestion Layer alone, no Assessment Layer call:
    python3 ingest.py --ingest-only "There is a positive association..."

    # Run the generation/disclosure comparison harness (needs a real API key --
    # the falsifiable test literature-engagement-addendum-v1.md names
    # as unresolved; --demo shows pre-recorded illustrative output instead):
    python3 ingest.py --compare-filler-ban "There is a positive association..."

No API key? Run with --demo to see pre-recorded output from all modes
without making a live call.

Do not analyze, flag ambiguity, or interpret. This is a mechanical pass only --
the rewrite must preserve the source's actual content while removing every
form of "to be."

# Runs the checkable analysis/ambiguity/adversarial pass against it. See
# SYNTHESIS/two-layer-architecture-v1.md for the three pass/fail criteria
# this prompt encodes.
#
# Two prompt variants exist: an unconstrained default, and a filler-word-
# banned variant for the comparison harness below. The Assessment Layer's
# prose counts as generation-stage work under literature-engagement-
# addendum-v1.md's framing (new synthesis, not a rewrite of an existing
# claim) -- which is exactly why the addendum's generation/disclosure
# distinction applies here and not to the Ingestion Layer above.

ASSESSMENT_PROMPT = """You are an E-Prime assessment system. You receive an
Ingestion Layer output (an original quote plus its E-Prime rewrite) and run
three checks against it. You do not alter the ingestion output. Produce:

1. Analysis -- name the specific word or phrase the E-Prime constraint forced
   out of the original sentence, then state what that word was hiding (a
   missing number, mechanism, or direction of causation). Gesturing at "more
   nuance" without naming the hidden item fails this check.
2. Ambiguity Flags -- state what neither the original source nor the rewrite
   resolves. A gap the rewrite itself already answers does not belong here.
3. Adversarial Interpretation -- give two readings: how a reader motivated to
   dismiss the claim could misuse the rewrite, and how a reader motivated to
   accept it could misuse the rewrite. One-sided answers fail this check.
4. Confidence Assessment -- integer 1-5. 5 = motivated misreading now requires
   visibly adding language. 1 = rewrite barely changes readability.

Output as valid YAML only. No markdown fences. No preamble.

analysis: |
